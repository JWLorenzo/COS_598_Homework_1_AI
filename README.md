## Notetaking

Current ideas for each guard:

Red: Forgot to take his ADHD Meds
- Patrolling
    - Bounces around like the old DVD screensaver
- Chasing
    - Take two points in rapid succession, estimate velocity and direction based on that vector, then use that as a coordinate for the next bounce that would travel that path. 

- Additional Effects
    - Movement speed increased

Blue: Messing around with his herman miller
- Patrolling
    - Spins in place
- Chasing
    - When it spots the target, it darts towards them
- Additional Effects
    - After chasing, linear rotation velocity increments to get back up to speed

Yellow: Actually acts like a sane human being
- Patrolling
    - Wanders around normally
- Chasing
    - Chases target while in view 

Random Voicelines in patrol state:

Yellow: Wow blue, you really like that new herman miller
Blue: Wheeee!

Yellow: Red, are you ok?
Red: Yea, I'm good -> next wall is a thunk sound

Blue: I don't feel so good
Red: Same, my head hurts
Yellow: Excellent work you two...
